To connect to the endpoint in the main.go file, you need to use your IP address. Go to your Wi-Fi settings, and there you will find your IP. Use that IP in the Tripform file, specifically on line 82:
const url = 'http://<your computerâ€™s IP>:8080/?api_key=Z1Y5yvAIwxfVOzHn444W4BO2bf8YIqmM-rsZUXGuCV8=';

If you are running main.go locally, you can use localhost instead of the IP:
const url = 'http://localhost:8080/?api_key=Z1Y5yvAIwxfVOzHn444W4BO2bf8YIqmM-rsZUXGuCV8=';
